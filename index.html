                    Hello! I’m Sheela Aprameya, a budding web designer and developer with a passion for creating engaging and user-friendly digital experiences. My journey into web development began as a hobby, and I’ve embraced the challenge of transitioning from a homemaker to a dedicated tech enthusiast after raising two wonderful children for 26 years.
            
                    Though I hold a degree in Architecture, I’ve found my true calling in the world of web design and development. My architectural background has instilled in me a strong sense of aesthetics, precision, and spatial awareness, which I apply to my web projects. As a mostly self-taught learner, I bring an avid curiosity to everything I do, constantly seeking to deepen my knowledge and skills.
            
                    My strengths include:
            
                    I am an avid Learner. I thrive on new challenges and enjoy exploring the latest trends and technologies in web design.
                    Being a natural problem solver, I love tackling complex issues, whether it’s debugging code or optimizing user experiences, always striving to find effective solutions.
                    I am dedicated and committed to my craft, pouring my heart and soul into each project.
                    My keen attention to detail ensures that every element of my work is polished and meets high standards of quality.
            
                    I’m excited to continue my journey in web development, blending creativity with technical expertise, and I look forward to crafting unique digital experiences that make a difference. Thank you for visiting my portfolio!</div>
